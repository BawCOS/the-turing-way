# Open Life Science mentoring and Training

[Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/) is a 16-week mentoring and training program for early-stage researchers and potential academic leaders who want to become ambassadors for Life Science in their communities.

## The Turing Way collaborates with OLS: *OLS-2 for Turing*

**Mentoring period: September to December 2020**

To specifically support members at The Alan Turing Institute, they have collaborated with _The Turing Way_ to offer “OLS-2 for Turing” training and mentoring for projects run by individuals or teams to help integrate open research practices in their workflow.
See details here: [https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators)

## OLS-2 for Turing projects

Congratulations to the following 6 projects that will join the second cohort (OLS-2) under the collaboration *OLS-2 for Turing*.
See [this post for the announcement](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/09/01/ols2-announcement/) along with the [details of 31 projects](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/) that will be trained and mentored in OLS-2.
